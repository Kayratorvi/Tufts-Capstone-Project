# What is it?
My project will allow a user to produce a computer accompaniment that can match the intonation of the player. It will adjust the intonation of the other notes in each chord based on the input from the performer using Just Intonation (pictured below) or the standard Equal Temperament depending on user preference.

# Who would want to use this?
In the music industry, students and individuals looking to make personal recordings for auditions or other endeavors must either hire an accompanist, fit their tuning and style to computerized recordings, or play without accompaniment.
Authentic, well-tuned accompaniment is expensive, whether thatâ€™s through a human accompanist or advanced computer tuning. 
A pianist can cost around $60/hour for human accompaniment. 
Auto-tune software usually involves tuning the human user and not the accompaniment, leading to an inauthentic performance.
Playing with a recording forces a performer to lose their individual interpretation of a piece.

# How does it work?
A user would provide a MIDI file of the accompaniment and a recording of their own part as input and should decide to either use Equal Temperament or Just Intonation.
Analysis of their recording is performed to decide adjustments to accompaniment.
Program outputs a recording of the accompaniment with adjustments made to the tuning to match the human performer.
