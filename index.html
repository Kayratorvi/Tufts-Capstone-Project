        <h1>Gavin Grooms's Master's Capstone Project<br>Weekly Status Report</h1>
        <h2>Sept. 10-16 Report</h2>
        <p>
            This week we had our first meetup with Prof. Allen where we discussed the structure of this capstone project. I also began to brainstorm project ideas, as up to this point I hadn't locked down any concrete ideas for what to build. Instead of coming up with one idea, I wrote down three to consider that I submitted in my project proposal. Here are the ideas:
            <ol>
            <li>
                I want to develop an app that can re-tune accompaniment music to fit your custom tuning or can even re-tune music based on MIDI input automatically.
            </li>

            <li>
                I could build an application to meet the needs of an exchange student management company. The app would securely manage forms, data, and applications, etc. in an organized manner using feedback from my parents who work in that industry.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                I want to develop an app/discord bot that would help me manage my Pokémon collecting in a much more organized manner. Currently you have to use separate apps for tracking a hunt, managing your collection, and looking up information on how a Pokémon is caught or the odds of catching a particular one. This app would combine everything in a seamless interface
            </li>
            </ol>
            Each one of these ideas has something uniquely appealing to me, which is why I included all three. The first idea is clearly the most challenging, and would require algorithms and the use of languages and libraries I have little to no experience with. It could end up only as a proof of concept, but it is exciting and combines my two degrees, Music Performane and Computer Science, which is really cool.
            <br><br>
            The second idea is a full product that I would develop that has potential as a marketable application. It would require the use of a lot of languages and infrastructure to build, as ideally I would have both a web application and a mobile app that are connected.
            <br><br>
            The third idea is much more of a fun idea, as I would be able to build something just for me. To be honest, I may build it even if it isn't my capstone project. It would be fun to try and come up with several ways to interface with the data that I want to manage.
            <br><br>
            Hopefully I will receive feedback soon on what might help me most in helping me start my career as a software engineer. It really depends on whether having a finished product or a more complex project is more important. 
        </p>
        <h2>Sept. 17-23 Report</h2>
        <p>
            This week I have been working on deciding what my project will be of the three ideas I submitted last week. So far, the favorite has been project idea #1, which is both exciting and daunting. I have much less confidence in my ability to build this project than I do with the other two ideas. That is however a good thing, as success in a more difficult endeavor will surely be more impressive to potential employers.
            <br><br>
            The problem is that further research into what it would take to build this project has revealed that I would need to build two complex components that both work with each other. It is far more likely that I would only have time to do one of them.
            <ul>
                <li>I would need an intonation interpreter, something that can listen to a .wav or .mp3 file and determine the tuning of each pitch in the file. MIDI does not store tuning data whatsoever and thus would not be sufficient alone.</li>
                <li>The other component would be to build a software synthesizer that can play a MIDI file while automatically adjusting to the tuning input from a user or from the previous component. I looked into a programming API called CSound which may assist greatly in completing this particular task.</li>
            </ul>
            Either one of these components would be fairly complex. While it would definitely be cool to learn to build either one or both, I'm definitely apprehensive concerning the task(s) at hand. I have no knowledge on any of the tools I would need to use, and a significant portion of this project would be spent on learning to use them. If I chose instead to implement one of my other ideas, I would be able to get started much sooner, as there wouldn't be nearly as much I would need to learn from scratch. It would be great to get some feedback on my concerns and on which project idea I should move forward with.
        </p>
        <h2>Sept. 24-30 Report</h2>
        <p>
            This week I outlined my project requirements, including what problem this project is meant to solve, what my solution is, and a high-level explanation of how I intend to implement the solution. Much of this is well explained in the README of my GitHub repository, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/Kayratorvi/Tufts-Capstone-Project">here</a>.
            <br><br>
            I met with Marty Allen during our biweekly meeting and presented my project requirements and was asked some valuable questions:
            <ul>
                <li>How do I prove that my project does what I say it does to someone with limited experience in music and intonation?</li>
                <li>What can I do to ensure that my ambitious project idea can be delivered in some completed form in May 2024?</li>
                <li>What kind of input should I expect users to provide? Is it too much to ask for users to provide MIDI files as input?</li>
                <li>Will I expect a live recording handled by my application, or will I expect a specific recording file format?</li>
            </ul>
            These are all important questions. I can verify the project's authenticity by using third-party tuners and verification from musicians I know that my project indeed retunes chords as defined in my project spec. I have also defined programming phases in my README that should guarantee an impressive, usable product that can be delivered as my capstone project. I also think it's reasonable to expect MIDI input as that is a growing medium that many college-level musicians have access to through their university benefits and education. I intend to answer the question of human recording later as I investigate various solutions.
            <br><br>
            I have approval to move forward with this project. I'm excited to see whether I am capable of success in such a challenging endeavor. If not, I do have a plan B project proposal involving a custom app for foreign exchange student management companies. This idea is not as exciting, but should still allow me the opportunity of building an application using many different tools, languages, and technologies.
        </p>
        <h2>Oct. 1-7 Report</h2>
        <p>
            This week I focused on researching existing libraries, APIs, and frameworks if any exist that might help facilitate my project. I discussed my project idea with my manager at my workplace, and he suggested I look into Audacity, which is an open-source audio editor. As it turns out, Audacity has full support for scripting in the Python language, and looks to have full capability for use as the synthesizer for my project. What this means is that I should be able to complete the first phase of this project using Audacity fairly quickly, allowing me to pursue the later phases of my project instead of spending all my time building a synthesizer from scratch.
            <br><br>
            My next step is to practice using Audacity enough to prove that it is fully capable of supporting my capstone project. This will be submitted as my Competency Demo. My plan is to write a small program that can retune 5 notes fed in from MIDI input. If I can do this, then the entirety of my first phase should be very doable. This will be my task for the coming week or so.
