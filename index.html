        <h1>Gavin Grooms's Master's Capstone Project<br>Weekly Status Report</h1>
        <h2>Sept. 10-16 Report</h2>
        <p>This week we had our first meetup with Prof. Allen where we discussed the structure of this capstone project. I also began to brainstorm project ideas, as up to this point I hadn't locked down any concrete ideas for what to build. Instead of coming up with one idea, I wrote down three to consider that I submitted in my project proposal. Here are the ideas:
            <ol>
            <li>I want to develop an app that can re-tune accompaniment music to fit your custom tuning or can even re-tune music based on MIDI input automatically.</li>

            <li>I could build an application to meet the needs of an exchange student management company. The app would securely manage forms, data, and applications, etc. in an organized manner using feedback from my parents who work in that industry.</li>
            
            <li>I want to develop an app/discord bot that would help me manage my Pokémon collecting in a much more organized manner. Currently you have to use separate apps for tracking a hunt, managing your collection, and looking up information on how a Pokémon is caught or the odds of catching a particular one. This app would combine everything in a seamless interface</li>
            </ol>
        Each one of these ideas has something uniquely appealing to me, which is why I included all three. The first idea is clearly the most challenging, and would require algorithms and the use of languages and libraries I have little to no experience with. It could end up only as a proof of concept, but it is exciting and combines my two degrees, Music Performane and Computer Science, which is really cool.<br><br>The second idea is a full product that I would develop that has potential as a marketable application. It would require the use of a lot of languages and infrastructure to build, as ideally I would have both a web application and a mobile app that are connected.<br><br>The third idea is much more of a fun idea, as I would be able to build something just for me. To be honest, I may build it even if it isn't my capstone project. It would be fun to try and come up with several ways to interface with the data that I want to manage.<br><br>

        Hopefully I will receive feedback soon on what might help me most in helping me start my career as a software engineer. It really depends on whether having a finished product or a more complex project is more important.
